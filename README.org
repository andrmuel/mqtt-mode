#+TITLE: mqtt-mode -- publish and subscribe to MQTT


* Overview

mqtt-mode provides a major mode for interaction with MQTT servers.

* Dependencies

This mode makes use of ~mosquitto_pub~ and ~mosquitto_sub~ from the
[[https://mosquitto.org/][Mosquitto]] MQTT server. Therefore ~mosquitto~ must be installed. They
are sometimes distributed as separate package.

Debian:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results verbatim
apt install mosquitto-clients
#+END_SRC

Gentoo:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results verbatim
emerge mosquitto
#+END_SRC

* Installation

To use this mode, add the repository to your load path, load it and
enable the major mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/mqtt-mode/")
(require 'mqtt-mode)
(mqtt-mode)
#+END_SRC

* Configuration

For configuration options, please look at the customization group
~mqtt-mode~. Most importantly, you should probably configure
- ~mqtt-host~ — host name of MQTT server
- ~mqtt-port~ — port of MQTT server
- ~mqtt-username~ — username for MQTT server
- ~mqtt-password~ — password for MQTT server
- ~mqtt-topic~ — topic to subscribe to
